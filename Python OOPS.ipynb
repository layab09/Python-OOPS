    " 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to organize and structure code. It emphasizes the principles of inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. In OOP, objects represent real-world entities, and classes define the structure and behavior of these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "   A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have. A class is essentially a template for objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.*What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "   An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete representation of the class and holds real values for the attributes defined in the class. Each object can have different states and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "    Abstraction hides the implementation details and shows only the essential features of an object. It allows you to focus on what an object does, not how it does it.\n",
    "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components and can be used to protect the integrity of the objectâ€™s data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5 What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "   Dunder methods, or \"magic methods,\" are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`). They allow you to define how objects behave in specific situations, like when they are printed, added together, or compared.\n",
    "\n",
    " 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
    "   Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows one class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). It promotes code reuse and allows the child class to extend or modify the behavior of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "   Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance. The most common example is method overriding, where a method in a derived class has the same name as a method in the parent class but behaves differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "   Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using private and protected access modifiers. While Python doesn't have strict access modifiers, a convention is followed:\n",
    "   - A single underscore (`_`) indicates a protected variable or method.\n",
    "   - A double underscore (`__`) makes the variable or method private, preventing access from outside the class (though it's still accessible through name mangling).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "   A constructor in Python is a special method `__init__()` used to initialize objects when they are created. It is automatically invoked when an object of a class is instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "     *What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "   - Class method: A method bound to the class and not the instance. It takes the class itself as the first argument (`cls`). Defined using the `@classmethod` decorator.\n",
    "   - **Static method**: A method that doesn't take any reference to the class or instance. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class. Defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n",
    "   - \n",
    " 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "   Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense (like in Java or C++). However, you can define a single method that accepts different numbers of arguments and handle it using default arguments or variable-length arguments (`*args` or `**kwargs`).\n",
    "\n",
    " 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "   Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the parent class method.\n",
    "\n",
    " 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "   The `@property` decorator in Python is used to define a method as a property. This allows you to define getter, setter, and deleter methods to manage the attributes of an object, while providing the ability to access them like normal attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "14*Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "   Polymorphism allows for flexibility and scalability in code. It enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, which simplifies code and allows the same interface to be used for different data types or objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "   An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is meant to be subclassed, and it often includes abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass. Abstract classes are defined using the `abc` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "   - **Modularity**: Code is organized into discrete objects.\n",
    "   - **Reusability**: Code can be reused through inheritance.\n",
    "   - **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and update code due to encapsulation.\n",
    "   - **Flexibility**: Polymorphism allows code to work with objects of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "   - **Class variable**: Shared by all instances of a class. It is defined inside a class but outside of any methods.\n",
    "   - **Instance variable**: Specific to an instance of a class. Each object has its own copy of instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    " 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "   Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. Python supports this form of inheritance, unlike some other languages like Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.\n",
    "   - `__str__` is used to define a human-readable string representation of an object, useful for printing.\n",
    "   - `__repr__` is used to define a string representation that ideally could be used to recreate the object. It is often used for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?\n",
    "   `super()` is used to call methods from a parent class in a subclass. It allows you to access and override parent class methods in child classes, promoting code reuse and method resolution order (MRO) in inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    " 21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
    "   The `__del__` method is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is a destructor method and can be used for cleanup, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?\n",
    "   - **`@staticmethod`**: A method that does not depend on the instance or class. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class.\n",
    "   - **`@classmethod`**: A method that takes the class as its first argument and can modify class variables.\n",
    "   - \n",
    " 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "   In Python, polymorphism works with inheritance by allowing subclasses to define methods with the same name as the parent class but with different behaviors. The method to call is determined at runtime, allowing different objects to respond in their own way to the same method call.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "   Method chaining is a programming technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line of code. This is possible when methods return the object itself (i.e., `self`).\n",
    "\n",
    " 25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
    "   The `__call__` method allows an object to be called like a function. When an instance of a class with a `__call__` method is invoked, this method is executed, providing behavior similar to a function."
